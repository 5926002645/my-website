      <h2>Future Job Impact of Biotechnology</h2>
      
      <p>
        As biotechnology continues to evolve, it is poised to have a significant impact on the job market in a variety of sectors. In the near future, biotechnology is expected to create a wide range of new jobs, particularly in fields like genetic engineering, bioinformatics, personalized medicine, and agricultural biotech. 
        Many of these positions will require highly specialized knowledge and skills, driving demand for professionals with backgrounds in molecular biology, chemistry, and computational biology.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        One of the key areas of growth will be in healthcare and pharmaceuticals, where advancements in gene editing, drug discovery, and regenerative medicine could lead to new treatment options for diseases that were previously untreatable. As a result, there will be an increasing need for research scientists, lab technicians, regulatory specialists, and healthcare professionals who can translate biotechnological innovations into practical applications.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Additionally, biotechnologyâ€™s impact will extend to the agricultural sector, where innovations like genetically modified crops and sustainable farming practices will demand expertise in agricultural biotechnology, environmental science, and bioengineering. While some routine jobs may be automated, the demand for skilled workers in biotech research and development will only increase.
