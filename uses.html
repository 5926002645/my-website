    <h1>Current Uses of Biotechnology</h1>
    
    <p>Biotechnology has a profound impact on various industries today, improving the way we live, work, and interact with the environment. From healthcare breakthroughs to innovations in agriculture and environmental sustainability, biotechnology is revolutionizing numerous sectors. Below are some of the key areas where biotechnology is making a difference.</p>

 
    <section class="biotech-section">
      <h2>Biotechnology in Healthcare</h2>
      <p>Biotechnology is playing an essential role in modern medicine, from the development of new drugs to gene therapies and personalized medicine. Some of the most significant applications include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Gene Editing and Therapy:</strong> Technologies like CRISPR are being used to edit genes, offering potential treatments for genetic disorders such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and certain types of cancer.</li>
        <li><strong>Vaccines:</strong> Biotechnology is critical in the development of vaccines, including mRNA vaccines that have played a crucial role in the fight against COVID-19.</li>
        <li><strong>Biopharmaceuticals:</strong> Biotech is responsible for producing life-saving biopharmaceuticals, such as insulin for diabetes and monoclonal antibodies for cancer treatment.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>


    <section class="biotech-section">
      <h2>Biotechnology in Agriculture</h2>
      <p>Biotechnology is transforming agriculture, making it possible to grow more food with fewer resources. Key uses in agriculture include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs):</strong> GMOs, such as Bt crops, are engineered to be resistant to pests and diseases, helping farmers reduce pesticide use and increase crop yields.</li>
        <li><strong>Crops with Enhanced Nutritional Value:</strong> Biotechnology has led to the development of "biofortified" crops, such as golden rice, which has higher levels of Vitamin A to combat malnutrition in developing countries.</li>
        <li><strong>Sustainable Farming:</strong> Biotechnology is being used to develop drought-resistant and salt-tolerant crops, helping to ensure food security in areas facing water scarcity or poor soil conditions.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="biotech-section">
      <h2>Biotechnology for Environmental Sustainability</h2>
      <p>Biotechnology is also playing a key role in addressing environmental challenges. Some important applications include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Bioremediation:</strong> Biotechnology is being used to clean up polluted environments. Certain bacteria can break down toxins in soil, water, and air, helping to remediate oil spills, industrial waste, and other contaminants.</li>
        <li><strong>Biofuels:</strong> Biotechnology is advancing the development of biofuels made from renewable sources such as algae, plant waste, and other biomass materials, providing cleaner alternatives to fossil fuels.</li>
        <li><strong>Waste-to-Energy:</strong> Through biotechnological processes, organic waste can be converted into energy, reducing landfill waste and providing a sustainable source of power.</li>
      </ul>
